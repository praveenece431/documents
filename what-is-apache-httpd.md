# Understanding Apache HTTP Server (httpd)

### Apache HTTP Server, also known as httpd, is a popular open-source web server used to host and deploy web applications.

#### What httpd Does:
1. Listens for incoming HTTP requests
2. Default http port is 80
3. Default https port is 443
4. Processes requests and serves static web pages, images, and other resources
#### httpd Directory Structure:
1. /etc/apache2: Holds configuration files, such as apache2.conf and sites-available/
2. /var/www: The directory where web applications and websites are hosted
3. /var/log/apache2: Contains log files generated by httpd, useful for troubleshooting and monitoring
4. /usr/lib/apache2/modules: Stores modules and libraries used by httpd
#### Key Concepts:
Virtual Host: A configuration that defines a website or web application, including its document root and settings
Document Root: The directory where website files are stored (e.g., /var/www/html)
Module: A software component that adds functionality to httpd (e.g., PHP, SSL)
httpd Workflow:
A user requests a resource (e.g., http://localhost/index.html)
httpd receives the request and maps it to a virtual host
httpd serves the requested resource from the document root
If necessary, httpd invokes a module (e.g., PHP) to process the request
The response is generated and sent back to the user
You can copy and paste this into a (link unavailable) file!
Note: The directory structure and configuration files may vary depending on the Ubuntu version and httpd configuration.
