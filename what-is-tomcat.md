# Understanding Tomcat

### Tomcat, also known as Apache Tomcat, is a popular open-source dynamic web server and servlet container used to host and deploy web applications.

## What Tomcat Does?
* Listens for incoming HTTP requests
* Default uses http port 8080
* Processes requests and serves web pages, images, and other resources
* Manages and runs Java-based web applications (servlets, JSPs, etc.)
* Provides a platform for deploying and managing web applications

## Tomcat Directory Structure:
```bash
/bin: Contains executable files, like startup.sh and shutdown.sh, used to start and stop Tomcat.
/conf: Holds configuration files, such as server.xml, which defines Tomcat's settings and behavior.
/lib: Stores Java libraries (JAR files) required by Tomcat and web applications.
/logs: Contains log files generated by Tomcat, useful for troubleshooting and monitoring.
/webapps: The directory where web applications (WAR files or exploded directories) are deployed.
/work: Temporary directory used by Tomcat for compiling JSPs and storing other temporary data.
```

#### Key Concepts:
```bash
Context: A web application's context path, e.g., /sample for a sample.war file.
Servlet: A Java class that handles HTTP requests and responses.
Web Application: A collection of servlets, JSPs, and resources packaged in a WAR file or directory.
```

#### Tomcat Workflow:
```bash
A user requests a resource (e.g., http://localhost:8080/sample/index.jsp)
Tomcat receives the request and maps it to a web application (context)
The web application's servlet container (e.g., Catalina) processes the request
The servlet container invokes the appropriate servlet or JSP to handle the request
The response is generated and sent back to the user

### Tomcat Installation steps in Ubuntu OS:

#### Step 1: Install Java
Open a terminal and run the following command to install OpenJDK 11:4
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y openjdk-11-jdk
java -version
```

#### Step 2: Install Tomcat
Download the latest Tomcat 9.x version from the official website:
```bash
wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.91/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.91.tar.gz
tar -xvf apache-tomcat-9.0.91.tar.gz
sudo mv  apache-tomcat-9.0.91 /opt/tomcat
```
Create a symbolic link for easier access:
```bash
sudo ln -s /opt/tomcat/bin/startup.sh /usr/local/bin/tomcat
```

#### Step 3: Configure Tomcat
```bash
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/false tomcat
sudo groupadd tomcat
sudo chown -R tomcat:tomcat /opt/tomcat
sudo tomcat
```

#### Step 5: Deploy a Sample WAR File
```bash
wget http://csci.viu.ca/~barskym/teaching/DM2012/labs/LAB6/Lab6A.war
sudo mv Lab6A.war /opt/tomcat/webapps/
sudo tomcat restart
```
