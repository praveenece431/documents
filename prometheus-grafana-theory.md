## What is Prometheus?

**Prometheus** is an open-source **monitoring and alerting toolkit** designed for reliability and scalability. It was originally developed by SoundCloud and is now a part of the **Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)**. Prometheus is widely used for monitoring systems, collecting metrics, and generating alerts based on those metrics.

It is particularly well-suited for **cloud-native environments** like Kubernetes due to its ability to handle dynamic and ephemeral infrastructure.

---

## Why is Prometheus Used?

Prometheus is used for **observability**, which refers to the ability to understand the internal state of a system by analyzing the data it produces. Below are the key reasons why Prometheus is widely used:

1. **Metrics Collection**: Collects metrics from applications and systems using a **pull-based model**.
2. **Powerful Query Language (PromQL)**: Allows complex queries, visualizations, and alerting rules.
3. **Alerting**: Integrates with **Alertmanager** to send alerts to various channels.
4. **Kubernetes Integration**: Dynamically discovers services and pods using Kubernetes APIs.
5. **Scalability and Reliability**: Handles large-scale environments with high cardinality metrics.
6. **Visualization**: Integrates seamlessly with **Grafana** for advanced dashboards.
7. **Open-Source and Extensible**: Large ecosystem of exporters, integrations, and libraries.

## Architectural Components of Prometheus

Prometheus has a modular architecture with several key components:

### 1. **Prometheus Server**
- Core component responsible for:
  - **Scraping metrics** from targets.
  - **Storing metrics** in a time-series database (TSDB).
  - Providing a **query interface** (PromQL).

### 2. **Exporters**
- Lightweight services or libraries that expose metrics in Prometheus format.
- Examples:
  - **Node Exporter**: System-level metrics.
  - **Blackbox Exporter**: Endpoint availability and latency.
  - **MySQL Exporter**: Database metrics.

### 3. **Pushgateway**
- Used for **short-lived jobs** or batch processes that cannot be scraped directly.
- Jobs push their metrics to the Pushgateway, which Prometheus scrapes.

### 4. **Alertmanager**
- Handles alerts generated by Prometheus.
- Features:
  - **Deduplication**, **grouping**, and **routing** of alerts.
  - Sends notifications to channels like email, Slack, PagerDuty, etc.

### 5. **Service Discovery**
- Automatically discovers targets in dynamic environments like Kubernetes, AWS, and GCP.

### 6. **Time-Series Database (TSDB)**
- Stores metrics as time-series data with labels and timestamps.

### 7. **PromQL (Prometheus Query Language)**
- Query language for analyzing metrics.
- Example: `rate(http_requests_total[5m])` calculates the per-second rate of HTTP requests over the last 5 minutes.

### 8. **Web UI**
- Built-in interface for querying metrics and visualizing simple graphs.

## What is Grafana?

**Grafana** is an open-source **data visualization and monitoring tool** that allows you to create interactive and customizable dashboards. It is widely used for visualizing metrics, logs, and traces collected from various data sources, including **Prometheus**, **Elasticsearch**, **InfluxDB**, **MySQL**, and many others.

---

## Why is Grafana Used?

Grafana enhances **observability** by providing a powerful and flexible way to visualize and analyze metrics, logs, and traces. Below are the key reasons why Grafana is widely adopted:

1. **Data Visualization**: Create interactive dashboards with graphs, heatmaps, tables, and more.
2. **Multi-Source Support**: Connects to various data sources like Prometheus, Elasticsearch, and MySQL.
3. **Customizable Dashboards**: Combine multiple data sources into a single dashboard.
4. **Alerting**: Define thresholds and send notifications to email, Slack, PagerDuty, etc.
5. **Real-Time Monitoring**: Provides real-time updates for live systems.
6. **Ease of Use**: Intuitive web-based interface for building dashboards.
7. **Community and Plugins**: Extensive library of plugins for additional data sources and visualizations.

---

## Architectural Components of Grafana

Grafana's architecture is modular and extensible, consisting of the following components:

### 1. **Frontend**
- Web-based **user interface** for creating dashboards, querying data, and managing alerts.

### 2. **Backend**
- Core server written in **Go**.
- Handles:
  - API requests.
  - User authentication and authorization.
  - Querying data sources.
  - Storing dashboard configurations.

### 3. **Data Sources**
- Grafana connects to various **data sources** like:
  - **Prometheus** (metrics).
  - **Elasticsearch** (logs).
  - **MySQL/PostgreSQL** (relational data).
  - **Cloud providers** like AWS CloudWatch and Google Cloud Monitoring.

### 4. **Plugins**
- Extend Grafana's functionality with:
  - **Data Source Plugins**: Add support for new data sources.
  - **Panel Plugins**: Add new visualization types.
  - **App Plugins**: Provide end-to-end solutions for specific use cases.

### 5. **Dashboard Engine**
- Manages and renders dashboards.
- Supports dynamic dashboards with variables and templates.

### 6. **Alerting Engine**
- Evaluates alert rules and sends notifications to channels like email and Slack.

### 7. **Authentication and Authorization**
- Supports multiple authentication methods:
  - Basic Authentication.
  - OAuth (Google, GitHub, etc.).
  - LDAP for enterprise environments.

### 8. **Storage**
- Stores:
  - Dashboard configurations.
  - User settings.
  - Alerting rules.

### 9. **Visualization Panels**
- Building blocks of dashboards.
- Each panel represents a single visualization (e.g., graph, table, gauge).
